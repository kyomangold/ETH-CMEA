# Computational Methods for Engineering Applications

This is the repository for the code files of the **Computational Methods for Engineering Applications** lecture at ETH Zurich taught by Dr. Carlos Pares Pulido. The lecture covered the following topics

- Initial value problems for ODE:
  - Review of basic theory for ODEs
  - Forward and Backward Euler methods
  - Taylor series methods
  - Runge-Kutta methods
  - Basic stability and consistency analysis
  - Numerical solution of stiff ODEs

- Two-point boundary value problems:
  - Green's function representation of solutions
  - Maximum principle
  - Finite difference schemes
  - Stability analysis

- Elliptic equations:
  - Laplace's equation in one and two space dimensions
  - Finite element methods
  - Implementation of finite elements
  - Error analysis

- Parabolic equations:
  - Heat equation
  - Fourier series representation
  - Maximum principles
  - Finite difference schemes
  - Forward (backward) Euler
  - Crank-Nicolson method
  - Stability analysis

- Hyperbolic equations:
  - Linear advection equation
  - Method of characteristics
  - Upwind schemes and their stability
    
The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets as well as the code to the two (optional) capstone projects, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
